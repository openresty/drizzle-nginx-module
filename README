Description
    This is an nginx upstream module integrating libdrizzle
    ( https://launchpad.net/libdrizzle ) into nginx in an
    non-blocking and streamming way.

    Essentially it provides a very efficient and flexible way
    for nginx internals to access mysql, drizzle,
    as well as other RDBMS's that support the drizzle protocol
    or mysql protocol. Also it can serve as a direct REST
    interface to those RDBMS backends.

    It also has a builtin per-worker connection pool
    mechanism.

    Here's a sample configuration:

        upstream backend {
            drizzle_server 127.0.0.1:3306 dbname=test
                 password=some_pass user=monty protocol=mysql;
            drizzle_keepalive max=100 mode=single overflow=reject;
        }

    The drizzle_server directive supports the following options:

        * user
            mysql user name for login

        * password
            Specify mysql password for login.

        * dbname
            Specify default mysql database for the connection.
            Note that mysql does allow referecing tables belonging to different
            databases by qualifying table names with
            database names.

        * protocol
            Specify which wire protocol to use, "drizzle" or "mysql".
            Default to "drizzle".

        * charset
            Explicitly specify the charset for the mysql connection.
            Setting this option to a non-empty value will
            make ngx_drizzle send out a "set names 'user_charset'" query
            right after the mysql connection is established.
            If the default character encoding of the mysql connection
            is already what you want, you needn't set this option
            because it has extra runtime cost. Here is a small
            example:

                drizzle_server foo.bar.com:3306 user=monty password=some_pass
                    dbname=test protocol=mysql
                    charset=utf8;

            Note that for the mysql server, "utf-8" is not a valid
            encoding name while "utf8" is ;)

    The drizzle_keepalive directive has the following options:

        * max=<num>
            Specify the capacity of the connection pool for
            the current upstream block. The <num> value MUST
            be non-zero. If set to 0, it effectively disables
            the connection pool. And this is the default
            if no "drizzle_keepalive" directive is specified.

        * mode=<mode>
            This supports two values, "single" and "multi".
            "single" mode means the pool does not distinguish
            various drizzle servers in the current ustream
            block while "multi" means the pool will merely
            reuse connections which have identical server
            host names and ports. Note that it will igore
            differences between dbnames or users.
            Default to "single".

        * overflow=<action>
            This option specifies what to do when the
            connection pool is already full while new
            database connection is required. Either "reject"
            (without quotes) or "ignore" can be specified.
            In case of "reject", it will reject the current
            request, and returns "503 Service Unavaliable"
            error page. For "ignore", this module will
            go on creating a new DB connection.

    For now, the connection pool uses a simple LIFO algorithm
    to assign idle connections in the pool. That is,
    most recently (successfully) used connections will be
    reused first the next time. And new idle connections
    will always replace the oldest idle connections in the
    pool even if the pool is already full.

Last Insert ID
    If you want to get LAST_INSERT_ID, then ngx_drizzle already
    returns that automatically for you when you're doing a SQL insert
    query. Consider the following sample nginx.conf snippet:

       location /test {
           echo_location /mysql "drop table if exists foo";
           echo;
           echo_location /mysql "create table foo (id serial not null,
    primary key (id), val real);";
           echo;
           echo_location /mysql "insert into foo (val) values (3.1415926);";
           echo;
           echo_location /mysql "select * from foo;";
           echo;
       }
       location /mysql {
           drizzle_pass backend;
           drizzle_module_header off;
           drizzle_query $query_string;
           rds_json on;
       }

    Then GET /test gives the following outputs:

       {"errcode":0}
       {"errcode":0}
       {"errcode":0,"insert_id":1,"affected_rows":1}
       [{"id":1,"val":3.1415926}]

    You can see the "insert_id" field in the 3rd JSON response.

Caveats

    * Other usptream modules like "upstream_hash" and
      "upstream_keepalive" MUST NOT be used with this module
      in a single upstream block.

    * Directives like "server" MUST NOT be mixed with
      "drizzle_server" either.

    * Upstream backends that don't use "drizzle_server" to
      define server entries MUST NOT be used in the
      "drizzle_pass" directive.

Directives

    drizzle_server <host>:<port> dbname=<dbname> password=<password> user=<user> protocol=<protocol>
        protocol can be either "mysql" or "drizzle".

    drizzle_query <sql>

    drizzle_connect_timeout <time>
        <time> can be an integer, with an optional time unit, like "s", "ms", "m".
        The default time unit is "s", ie, "second".

        default setting is "60 s".

    drizzle_send_query_timeout <time>

        default setting is "60 s".

    drizzle_recv_cols_timeout <time>
        default setting is "60 s".

    drizzle_recv_rows_timeout <time>
        default setting is "60 s".

    drizzle_buffer_size <size>
        the buffer size for drizzle outputs. default to the page size (4k/8k).
        the larger the buffer, the less streammy the outputing process will be.

    drizzle_module_header on|off
        controls whether to output the drizzle header in the response.
        default on.
        a drizzle header looks like this:

            X-Resty-DBD-Module: ngx_drizzle 0.0.14

    drizzle_status
        Emit a status report for all the drizzle upstream servers
        in the current location. The output looks like this:

            worker process: 15231

            upstream backend
              active connections: 0
              connection pool capacity: 10
              overflow: reject
              cached connection queue: 0
              free'd connection queue: 10
              cached connection successfully used count:
              free'd connection successfully used count: 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
              servers: 1
              peers: 1

            upstream backend2
              active connections: 0
              connection pool capacity: 0
              servers: 1
              peers: 1

Output
    This module generates binary query results in a format
    that will be shared among the various nginx database
    driver modules like ngx_postgresql and ngx_oracle.
    This data format is named "Resty DBD Stream" (RDS).

    If you're a web app developer, you may be more interested
    in using a source filter module like ngx_rds_json module
    ( http://github.com/agentzh/rds-json-nginx-module ) to
    obtain JSON output.

    For the HTTP response header part, the 200 OK status
    code should always be returned.

    The Content-Type header MUST be set to
    "application/x-resty-dbd-stream" (without quotes).

    And the driver generating this response is also set a
    X-Resty-DBD header. For instance, this
    module adds the following output header:

        X-Resty-DBD-Module: drizzle 0.0.1

    where 0.0.1 is this module's own version number. This
    X-Resty-DBD-Module header is optional though.

    Below is the HTTP response body format (version 0.0.3):

    Header part
        uint8_t        endian type (1 means big-endian and little
                       endian otherwise)

        uint32_t       format version
                       (v1.2.3 is represented as 1002003 in
                        decimal)

        uint8_t        result type
                       (0 means normal SQL result type,
                        fixed for now)

        uint16_t       standard error code
        uint16_t       driver-specific error code

        uint16_t       driver-specific error string length
        u_char*        driver-specific error string data

        uint64_t       database rows affected
        uint64_t       insert id (if none, 0)
        uint16_t       column count

    Body part

      when the "column count" field in the Header part
      is zero, then the whole body part is omitted.

      0*Column (number of columns is determined by "column count")

        uint16_t        non-zero value for standard column type
                        code and for the column list
                        terminatoandr otherwise.
        uint16_t        driver-specific column type code
        uint16_t        column name length
        u_char*         column name data

      0*Row (terminated by 8-bit zero)

        uint8_t         valid row (1 means valid, and 0 means
                        the row list terminator)

        0*Field (count is predetermined by column number)
            uint32_t        field length ((uint32_t) -1 represents NULL)
            uint8_t*        field data (in textual representation), is empty
                            if field length == (uint32_t) -1

    On the nginx output chain link level, the following
    components should be put into a single ngx_buf_t struct:

        * the header

        * each column and the column list terminator

        * each row's valid flag byte and row list terminator

        * each field in each row (if any) but the field data
          can span multiple bufs

Trouble Shooting
    * When you see the following error message in error.log

        failed to connect: 10: drizzle_state_handshake_server_read:bad packet size:52:74
            while connecting to drizzle upstream

      then you're probably trying to connect to a mysql 5.5+ server,
      which is not supported in the current version of libdrizzle.
      You can try urging libdrizzle's developers to add support for mysql 5.5+ or consider
      downgrading your mysql server to version 5.1.x or 5.0.x in order to use this module.

    * When you see the following error message in error.log:

         failed to connect: 15: drizzle_state_handshake_result_read:
             old insecure authentication mechanism not supported in upstream, ...

      then you may checkout if your mysql is too old (at least 5.x is required)
      or your mysql config file explicitly forces the use of old authentication
      method (you should remove the "old-passwords" line from your my.cnf and
      add the line "secure_auth 1").

    * When you see the following error message in error.log:

        failed to connect: 23: Access denied for user 'root'@'ubuntu'
        (using password: YES) while connecting to drizzle upstream, ...

      You should check if your mysql account does have got TCP login access on your
      mysql server side. A quick check is to use mysql's official client to connect
      to your server:

        mysql --protocol=tcp -u user --password=password -h foo.bar.com dbname

      Note that the --protocol=tcp option is required here, or your mysql client may
      use unix domain socket to connect to your mysql server.

Installation
    * You should first install libdrizzle 0.8 which can be
        obtained from here:

        https://launchpad.net/libdrizzle

    * Use the following patch in order to fix two serious bugs in
        libdrizzle:

        http://agentzh.org/misc/nginx/libdrizzle-0.8-parsebug_and_mac_fixes.patch

    * Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    drizzle-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/drizzle-nginx-module/downloads>).

    * Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
        example, the version 0.8.41 (see nginx compatibility), and then build
        the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.41.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.41.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.41/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/drizzle-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

Compatibility
    If you're using mysql, then mysql 5.0 ~ 5.1 is required. Please note that
    due to a bug in libdrizzle, mysql 5.5+ will not work; see the following
    ticket for details:

        https://bugs.launchpad.net/drizzle/+bug/677522

    If you try to connect to a mysql 5.5+ server, an error message will be
    printed to the nginx error.log file like this:

        failed to connect: 10: drizzle_state_handshake_server_read:bad packet size:52:74
            while connecting to drizzle upstream

    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x (last tested: 0.8.53)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.44 (last tested version is 0.7.67)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.44 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

TODO
    *   add the mysql transaction support.
    *   add multi-statement mysql query support.
    *   implement the "drizzle_max_output_size" directive.
        When the RDS data is larger then the size specified,
        the module will try to terminate the output as quickly
        as possible but will still ensure the resulting
        response body is still in valid RDS format.

    *   implement the "drizzle_upstream_next" mechanism for
        failover support.

    *   add support for multiple "drizzle_query" directives
        in a single location.

    *   implement *weighted* round-robin algorithm for the
        upstream server clusters.

    *   add the "max_idle_time" option to the "drizzle_server"
        directive, so that the connection pool will automatically
        release idle connections for the timeout you specify.

    *   add the "min" option to the "drizzle_server" directive
        so that the connection pool will automatically create
        that number of connections and put them into the pool.

    *   Unix domain socket support in the "drizzle_server"
        directive.

    *   Make the "drizzle_query" directive reject variables that
        have not been processed by a drizzle_process directive.
        This will pretect us from SQL injections. There will
        also be an option ("strict=no") to disable such checks.

Known Issues
    *   Calling mysql procedures are currently not supported because
        the underlying libdrizzle library does not support the
        CLIENT_MULTI_RESULTS flag yet :( But we'll surely work on it.

    *   Multiple SQL statements in a single query are not supported
        due to the lack of CLIENT_MULTI_STATEMENTS support in the
        underlying libdrizzle library.

    *   This module does not (yet) work with the RTSIG event model.
