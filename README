Description
    This is an nginx upstream module integrating libdrizzle
    ( https://launchpad.net/libdrizzle ) into nginx in an
    non-blocking and streamming way.

    Essentially it provides a very efficient and flexible way
    for nginx internals to access mysql, drizzle, sqlite3,
    as well as other RDBMS's that support the drizzle protocol
    or mysql protocol. Also it can serve as a direct REST
    interface to those RDBMS backends.

    It also has a builtin per-worker connection pool
    mechanism.

    Here's a sample configuration:

        upstream backend {
            drizzle_server 127.0.0.1:3306 dbname=test
                 password=some_pass user=monty protocol=mysql;
            drizzle_keepalive max=100 mode=single overflow=reject;
        }

    The drizzle_keepalive directive has the following options:

        * max=<num>
            Specify the capacity of the connection pool for
            the current upstream block. The <num> value MUST
            be non-zero. If set to 0, it effectively disables
            the connection pool. And this is the default
            if no "drizzle_keepalive" directive is specified.

        * mode=<mode>
            This supports two values, "single" and "multi".
            "single" mode means the pool does not distinguish
            various drizzle servers in the current ustream
            block while "multi" means the pool will merely
            reuse connections which have identical server
            host names and ports. Note that it will igore
            differences between dbnames or users.
            Default to "single".

        * overflow=<action>
            This option specifies what to do when the
            connection pool is already full while new
            database connection is required. Either "reject"
            (without quotes) or "ignore" can be specified.
            In case of "reject", it will reject the current
            request, and returns "503 Service Unavaliable"
            error page. For "ignore", this module will
            go on creating a new DB connection.

    For now, the connection pool uses a simple LIFO algorithm
    to assign idle connections in the pool. That is,
    most recently (successfully) used connections will be
    reused first the next time. And new idle connections
    will always replace the oldest idle connections in the
    pool even if the pool is already full.

Caveats

    * Other usptream modules like "upstream_hash" and
      "upstream_keepalive" MUST NOT be used with this module
      in a single upstream block.

    * Directives like "server" MUST NOT be mixed with
      "drizzle_server" either.

    * Upstream backends that don't use "drizzle_server" to
      define server entries MUST NOT be used in the
      "drizzle_pass" directive.

Output
    This module generates binary query results in a format
    that will be shared among the various nginx database
    driver modules like ngx_postgresql and ngx_oracle.
    This data format is named "Resty DBD Stream" (RDS).

    If you're a web app developer, you may be more interested
    in using a source filter module like ngx_rds_json module
    ( http://github.com/agentzh/rds-json-nginx-module ) to
    obtain JSON output.

    For the HTTP response header part, the 200 OK status
    code should always be returned.

    The Content-Type header MUST be set to
    "application/x-resty-dbd-stream" (without quotes).

    And the driver generating this response is also set a
    X-Resty-DBD header. For instance, this
    module adds the following output header:

        X-Resty-DBD-Module: drizzle 0.0.1

    where 0.0.1 is this module's own version number. This
    X-Resty-DBD-Module header is optional though.

    Below is the HTTP response body format (version 0.0.3):

    Header part
        uint8_t        endian type (1 means big-endian and little
                       endian otherwise)

        uint32_t       format version
                       (v1.2.3 is represented as 1002003 in
                        decimal)

        uint8_t        result type
                       (0 means normal SQL result type,
                        fixed for now)

        uint16_t       standard error code
        uint16_t       driver-specific error code

        uint16_t       driver-specific error string length
        u_char*        driver-specific error string data

        uint64_t       database rows affected
        uint64_t       insert id (if none, 0)
        uint16_t       column count

    Body part

      when the "column count" field in the Header part
      is zero, then the whole body part is omitted.

      0*Column (number of columns is determined by "column count")

        uint16_t        non-zero value for standard column type
                        code and for the column list
                        terminatoandr otherwise.
        uint16_t        driver-specific column type code
        uint16_t        column name length
        u_char*         column name data

      0*Row (terminated by 8-bit zero)

        uint8_t         valid row (1 means valid, and 0 means
                        the row list terminator)

        0*Field (count is predetermined by column number)
            uint32_t        field length ((uint32_t) -1 represents NULL)
            uint8_t*        field data (in textual representation), is empty
                            if field length == (uint32_t) -1

    On the nginx output chain link level, the following
    components should be put into a single ngx_buf_t struct:

        * the header

        * each column and the column list terminator

        * each row's valid flag byte and row list terminator

        * each field in each row (if any) but the field data
          can span multiple bufs

Installation
    You should first install the latest libdrizzle which can be
    obtained from here (last tested version of libdrizzle is 0.8):

        https://launchpad.net/libdrizzle

    Grab the nginx source code from nginx.net (<http://nginx.net/>), for
    example, the version 0.8.41 (see nginx compatibility), and then build
    the source with this module:

        $ wget 'http://sysoev.ru/nginx/nginx-0.8.41.tar.gz'
        $ tar -xzvf nginx-0.8.41.tar.gz
        $ cd nginx-0.8.41/

        # Here we assume you would install you nginx under /opt/nginx/.
        $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx \
            --add-module=/path/to/drizzle-nginx-module

        $ make -j2
        $ make install

    Download the latest version of the release tarball of this module from
    drizzle-nginx-module file list
    (<http://github.com/agentzh/drizzle-nginx-module/downloads>).

Compatibility
    The following versions of Nginx should work with this module:

    *   0.8.x (last tested version is 0.8.41)

    *   0.7.x >= 0.7.44 (last tested version is 0.7.67)

    Earlier versions of Nginx like 0.6.x and 0.5.x will *not* work.

    If you find that any particular version of Nginx above 0.7.44 does not
    work with this module, please consider reporting a bug.

TODO
    *   apply the fixed-size bufs model for the RDS emitter which is expected
        to give at least 100% performance boost for huge result set queries.

    *   implement the "drizzle_max_output_size" directive.
        When the RDS data is larger then the size specified,
        the module will try to terminate the output as quickly
        as possible but will still ensure the resulting
        response body is still in valid RDS format.

    *   implement the "drizzle_upstream_next" mechanism for
        failover support.

    *   add support for multiple "drizzle_query" directives
        in a single location.

    *   implement weighted round-robin algorithm for the
        upstream server clusters.

    *   add the "max_idle_time" option to the "drizzle_server"
        directive, so that the connection pool will automatically
        release idle connections for the timeout you specify.

    *   add the "min" option to the "drizzle_server" directive
        so that the connection pool will automatically create
        that number of connections and put them into the pool.

    *   Unix domain socket support in the "drizzle_server"
        directive.

    *   Make the "drizzle_query" directive reject variables that
        have not been processed by a drizzle_process directive.
        This will pretect us from SQL injections. There will
        also be an option ("strict=no") to disable such checks.

Known Issues
    *   This module does not (yet) work with the RTSIG event model.
